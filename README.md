# Machine Learning Specialization - Supervised Learning

This repository contains my work from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) on Coursera.

## Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning

### Week 1: Introduction to Supervised Learning
- **Concepts Covered**: Linear regression, loss function, model representation
- **Labs Completed**: 
  - `lab-01-linear-regression.ipynb`
  - `lab-02-gradient-descent.ipynb`
  - Optional labs included for extra practice

## About This Repo
This project tracks my progress through the course and demonstrates my learning through code and notes. All work is done using Jupyter notebooks.
