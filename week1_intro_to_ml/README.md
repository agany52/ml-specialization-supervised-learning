ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Specialization â€“ Module 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
Welcome to my journey through the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng! This first module introduces foundational concepts in machine learning, with a focus on supervised learning using regression techniques.

Throughout this module, I learned how to build and train predictive models using linear regression and gradient descent. I also got hands-on with Python and Jupyter Notebooks through coding labs and graded assignments.

ðŸ§  Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to Machine Learning

- What is ML?

- Applications and real-world impact

- Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning

- Supervised Learning

- Model representation (linear regression)

- Cost functions and model evaluation

- Gradient descent algorithm for optimization

- Unsupervised Learning

- High-level overview of clustering and pattern discovery

- Practical Tools

- Python basics for ML

- Using Jupyter Notebooks effectively

ðŸ§ª Labs & Projects
Hands-on labs provided valuable practice with:

- Representing models mathematically

- Visualizing cost functions

- Implementing and debugging gradient descent

- Tuning learning rates

âœ… All graded assignments submitted with a 100% score.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- Gained intuition for how machines learn from data

- Implemented linear regression from scratch

- Built a strong foundation for upcoming modules on classification, logistic regression, and neural networks

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python

- Jupyter Notebooks

- Numpy / Matplotlib (introduced in labs)

- Coursera Lab Environment
